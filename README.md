# Overview
This project uses IBM Watsonx.ai to build and compare machine learning models for detecting payment fraud. The goal is to create a smart system that can identify fraudulent transactions accurately, while minimizing false alerts.The experiment tested nine different pipelines using various algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter tuning. The best performer was Pipeline 9, which used Logistic Regression with feature engineering and optimization.

# Process
Step 1)Load dataset into IBM Watsonx.ai.
Step 2)Automatically split into training & testing sets.
Step 3)Apply preprocessing (data cleaning, encoding, scaling).
Step 4)Test multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression & XGB Classifier.
Step 5)Perform Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) and Feature Engineering (FE).
Step 6)Compare pipelines based on accuracy and other metrics.
