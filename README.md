# Project Overview

This project uses IBM Watsonx.ai to build and compare machine learning models for detecting payment fraud. The goal is to create a smart system that can identify fraudulent transactions accurately, while minimizing false alerts.The experiment tested nine different pipelines using various algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter tuning. The best performer was Pipeline 9, which used Logistic Regression with feature engineering and optimization.

## **Features**

* Automated comparison of multiple ML algorithms
* Feature engineering for improved model performance
* Hyperparameter optimization for best accuracy
* Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC
* Visualization of results using relationship maps and metric charts

## **Process**
Step 1)Load dataset into IBM Watsonx.ai.

Step 2)Automatically split into training & testing sets.

Step 3)Apply preprocessing (data cleaning, encoding, scaling).

Step 4)Test multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression & XGB Classifier.

Step 5)Perform Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) and Feature Engineering (FE).

Step 6)Compare pipelines based on accuracy and other metrics.
